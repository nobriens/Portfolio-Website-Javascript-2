    <h1>AIB Work</h1>
    <p>UX and UI work done during my internship with AIB. The two main projects I worked on were a branch locator and a Green Living quiz, which <br> helps users determine how environmentally friendly they are based on their daily actions. Due to an NDA, Im unable to share detailed insights on the <br> research and some aspects of the projects.</p>

        <h2>AIB Service Finder</h2>
        <p>The AIB Bank Service Finder was designed to help users quickly and easily locate banking products and services suited to their needs.

        <h2>Choose Your Services and Location</h2>
        <p>Users choose up to three banking services and enter their location to see branches nearby that offer exactly what they need.
Users see a list of nearby branches that match their selected services, with key info like hours, contact details, and availability. Tapping a branch reveals full details — including accessibility, facilities, and integrated map directions. Users can schedule appointments in advance to minimize waiting, ensuring theyre seen promptly and receive more efficient, personalized service—especially helpful for complex or time-sensitive needs.

        <h2>Comprehensive Branch Details for Informed Visits</h2>
        <p>When a branch is selected, users see detailed info to help plan their visit, including opening hours, contact details, and additional services like financial advice. Accessibility features such as wheelchair access, quiet spaces, and a sensory map are highlighted. Integrated directions make navigation easy, and conveniences like external ATMs, 7 day service, and parking are clearly shown to ensure users find the best branch for their needs.

        <h2>AIB Green Living Quiz</h2>
        <p>The GreenLiving Quiz was an interactive digital tool created to support AIBs commitment to sustainability. It educated users about eco conscious habits and helped them reflect on their environmental impact through a light, engaging format. I was involved from the very beginning through to final delivery of the Green Living Quiz as one of two core team members responsible for developing and delivering the tool. This gave me end-to-end ownership across research, design, content collaboration, and prototyping.

        <h2>Measuring Your Eco Habits and Receiving Your Personalised Report</h2>
        <p>Users answer questions about how often they practice eco-friendly habits—like recycling, reducing energy use, or choosing sustainable transport by sliding to indicate frequency. This lets them quickly share their lifestyle in an easy, interactive way. At the end of the quiz, users receive a personalized rating that reflects how eco-friendly their lifestyle is. This score gives clear insight into their habits and highlights areas where theyre doing well. Its a motivating way to encourage users to celebrate their progress and discover simple ways to live greener.
 After completing the quiz, users can download a detailed report summarizing their eco friendly score and personalized tips. This handy takeaway makes it easy to review their results anytime and share their green goals with friends or family.
